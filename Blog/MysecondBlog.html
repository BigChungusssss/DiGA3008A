<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>
In his essay, You say you want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media,
Stuart Moulthrop explores the promises and the paradox of hypertext , 
tracing it's roots as well as questioning  its revolutionery potential.
Inspired by philosophers like Marshall McLuhan and Theodore Nelson, Moulthrop examines whether
hypertext can truly democratize-or if it will simply fall into the hands of corporations.
</p>
<p>
Hypertext,
as envisioned by pioneers such as Nelson,
was meant to free knowledge from linear constraints.
Yet, as Moulthrop notes this dream has been largely overshadowed by commercial platforms like Yahoo! and CNN,
where information flows in a structured, consumption-driven manner rather than and open, participating web.
</p>
<p>
While hypertext was once imagined as a force for a radical change,
Moulthrop warns that without without active resistance,
it risks being co-opted into a controlled, commercialized system.
The revolution may not be as inevitable as we have hoped for.
